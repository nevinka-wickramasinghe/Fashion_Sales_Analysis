# Fashion Sales Analysis â€“ Customer & Sales Insights


# Project Overview

This project is an **exploratory data analysis** (EDA) of a fashion retail dataset, focused on uncovering insights about customer behavior, sales trends, product performance, and store operations. The goal was to **transform raw transactional data into actionable insights** to support decision-making in retail management.

The analysis includes trends in sales, customer purchase patterns, product category performance, payment behavior, and store-level performance across regions. Additionally, regression models were applied to forecast future sales trends.
